# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

After pushing your documentation setup to GitHub, follow these steps to activate GitHub Pages:

## 1. Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/janfincke/early-mcp-server
2. **Click Settings** (in the top navigation bar)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. **Under "Build and deployment":**
   - Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - This enables the GitHub Actions workflow we created

## 2. Verify Workflow Permissions

1. **Still in Settings**, go to **"Actions"** â†’ **"General"**
2. **Under "Workflow permissions":**
   - Select **"Read and write permissions"**
   - Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
3. **Click "Save"**

## 3. Trigger First Deployment

The first deployment will happen automatically when you:
- Push to the `main` branch
- The workflow file (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`) will run automatically

## 4. Check Deployment Status

1. **Go to the "Actions" tab** in your repository
2. **Look for "Deploy Documentation"** workflow
3. **Click on the workflow run** to see progress
4. **Green checkmark** = successful deployment

## 5. Access Your Documentation

Once deployment completes:
- **URL**: https://janfincke.github.io/early-mcp-server/
- **Usually takes 2-5 minutes** for first deployment
- **Updates automatically** on future pushes to main branch

## 6. Verify Everything Works

Visit your documentation site and check:
- [ ] Landing page loads correctly
- [ ] Navigation works between pages
- [ ] All 6 tool pages are accessible
- [ ] Images and styling appear correctly
- [ ] Search functionality works

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error details
2. Ensure all markdown files are valid
3. Verify `mkdocs.yml` syntax is correct
4. Check that Python requirements are installable

### If pages don't load:
1. Wait a few more minutes (GitHub Pages can be slow)
2. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
3. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) in your browser
4. Verify the workflow completed successfully

### If styling looks broken:
1. Check that `docs/assets/extra.css` was included
2. Verify the site_url in `mkdocs.yml` is correct
3. Check browser console for any loading errors

## Next Steps

Once GitHub Pages is working:
1. **Update README badges** to point to live documentation
2. **Add more documentation pages** as needed:
   - Integration guide (`docs/integration.md`)
   - Architecture documentation (`docs/architecture.md`)
   - Troubleshooting guide (`docs/troubleshooting.md`)
3. **Test the documentation** with real users
4. **Set up branch protection** to require successful docs build before merging PRs

## Customization

To customize further:
- **Custom domain**: Add `CNAME` file to `docs/` directory
- **Analytics**: Add tracking codes to `mkdocs.yml`
- **Theme colors**: Modify palette in `mkdocs.yml`
- **Additional plugins**: Install via `docs/requirements.txt`

**Expected Result**: Professional documentation website automatically updated whenever you push to main branch!
